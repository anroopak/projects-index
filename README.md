# Index of Projects
All Projects I am working on and am planning to work on

## TODO
- [ ] Git diff the functions 
  - Do a diff on files. Show differences in context of each method / function, instead of line diff
- [ ] Pact equivalent
  - The open source project Pact allows an innovative way to do integration tests of multiple services. It has a Consumer first approach. The project has not grown much. I wish to create a project which is equivalent of Pact.
  - This project should focus on creating a language neutral (OR easily codeable OR use a dsl) framework so that the project can be used for any service.
